# Simple Static Website for Testing

This repository contains the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for a simple static website. It's specifically created for testing purposes, such as practicing Git workflows, setting up CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, or experimenting with web deployment strategies.

## Files Included

* `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the website.
* `styles.css`: Contains the basic styling for the website.
* `script.js`: Includes simple JavaScript for basic interactivity.

## Purpose

This project serves as a minimal web application that can be easily managed in a Git repository and deployed through automation tools. It demonstrates a fundamental web page structure and allows for testing various stages of a software development lifecycle, including:

* Version control with Git.
* Setting up and configuring CI/CD pipelines (e.g., with Jenkins).
* Deploying static content to web servers or hosting platforms.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository)

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**
    Simply navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the `index.html` file with your preferred web browser.

## Testing Scenarios

Here are a few ideas for how you can use this project for testing:

* **Basic Git Operations:** Practice committing changes, creating branches, merging, and resolving conflicts.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Configure a Jenkins pipeline to automatically build (though there's no build process for static sites), test (you could add simple linters or validators), and deploy the website on code changes.
* **Web Hosting:** Deploy the contents of this repository to a static web hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
* **Automation Scripts:** Write scripts to perform tasks like copying files, running simple tests, or deploying the website.
